# DevOps Project with Terraform and CI/CD Pipelines

## Overview

This DevOps project demonstrates the use of Terraform for provisioning public cloud instances. Additionally, it includes CI/CD pipelines for automating the deployment process.

## Features

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Public cloud instances provisioning

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured:

- Terraform
- [CI/CD tool of choice (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)]
- [Public cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)]

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-terraform-project.git
    cd devops-terraform-project
    ```

2. Update Terraform variables in `terraform/variables.tf` with your specific configurations.

3. Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    cd terraform
    terraform init
    ```

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to confirm the changes.

## CI/CD Pipelines

This project includes CI/CD pipelines that automatically trigger on new commits to the main branch. The pipelines perform the following steps:

- **Linting**: Ensure Terraform code adheres to best practices and styling.
- **Unit Testing**: Run unit tests on Terraform modules.
- **Deployment**: Deploy infrastructure changes using Terraform.
